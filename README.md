# dotfiles üè°

An evolving collection of little bits that make a computer feel like home. I spend too much time tweaking these.

### Installation
These are made for OSX:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/victornguyen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./scripts/install
```

`install` runs several other scripts in `scripts/`, which can also be run independently.

### What's in them?
Things I've stolen across the Internet that primarily setup my shell (zsh), editor (vim) and multiplexer (tmux). Will expand on this later!
