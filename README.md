# dotfiles üè°

An evolving collection of little bits that make a computer feel like home. I spend too much time tweaking these.

### Installation
These aren't built to be distributed (yet). I just symlink the appropriate files and directories myself. _Like an animal_. I'm eventually going to script this process to help Future Victor.

### What's in them?
Things I've stolen across the Internet that primarily setup my shell (zsh), editor (vim) and multiplexer (tmux).
